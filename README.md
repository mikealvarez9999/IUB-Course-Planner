# IUB Course Planner

Assalamualaikum! 👋

As a student of Independent University, Bangladesh (IUB), I was tired of juggling between our sloggy registration portal iRAS’s messy course offers and my jumbled-up paper notes just to figure out a few conflict‑free plans for registration. That’s where the idea for this tool came from. I wanted a single app that would take all those messy course offers, present them cleanly, and let me build as many plans as I want—without overlaps, without hassle.

Today, I’m excited to share the result:  
✨ **IUB Course Planner v1.0** ✨

A tiny, fast web app to help you breeze through course planning before registration.

## 🚀 Features

- **Browse real iRAS course offers** in a clean table (desktop) or cards (mobile)
- **Search** by course code, title, or faculty
- **Filter** by day group (ST, MW, AR) or seat availability
- **Build multiple plans** — with automatic conflict checks (no overlaps!)
- **Rename, duplicate, and delete** your plans
- **Light/Dark mode** and responsive UI for PC or mobile
- **Export your plan as a JPG**: One click saves a snapshot of your routine grid + selected sections as a single image (perfect for registration time!)
- **PWA enabled**: Install on mobile via “Add to Home Screen”
- **Data privacy**: No ads, no trackers. Logout clears your data.

## 📝 How to Use

1. **Open the app:** [https://mikealvarez9999.github.io/IUB-Course-Planner](https://mikealvarez9999.github.io/IUB-Course-Planner)
2. Click **“iRAS Login”** and sign in with your iRAS credentials.
3. Click **“Course Refresh”** to pull the latest offers (wait a few seconds for courses to load).
4. Browse/search courses, then hit **“Add To Plan”** on the sections you want.
5. When you’re happy with your plan, hit **“Export this plan (JPG)”** to save a clean snapshot.
6. That’s it! ✨

**Tip:** If the login window doesn’t open, please allow popups for the site. This shouldn't usually happen.

## 💡 Why This Helps

- Try unlimited combos: no more paper-crumbling math!
- Conflict prevention: no overlapping sections in your plan.
- If iRAS suddenly shows nothing (we IUBians have all been there), the app shows your last saved backup* so you don’t lose your work.
- Works on any device: PC or mobile. Looks clean everywhere.

---

## ⚠️ A Few Notes

- *The last-saved backup is cached in your browser. If you use incognito mode or clear cache, the backup will disappear.
- This is **not** an official IUB tool—just a side project to help make registration a little less stressful.
- Your iRAS login is **never stored** or sent anywhere except iRAS.
- No ads, no trackers, nothing shady.
- Logging out clears your data so others can’t peek.

---

## 🛣️ Roadmap

- More robust plan restore (even after clearing cache/incognito)
- Export/import plans as files
- More filters and small UX improvements
